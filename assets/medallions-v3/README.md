# All 50 generated medallion faces

Generated September 18, 2026 with built-in image_gen, one call per theme. Replaces the initial procedural SVG designs at the user's request to use the approved medallion method.

Grand Touring uses ../medallions-v2/first-track-redline.png as a style reference. Each other theme uses the generated Grand Touring face as its edit reference. All five outputs were visually inspected for lettering, motif, front-only circular composition and palette. The map is decorative generated illustration, not geographic data. Three.js supplies the coin body and moving reflections.

## Runtime preparation

Run `node --experimental-strip-types scripts/prepare-medallion-assets.cjs medallions-v3` from mobile/recorder. This uses the existing collection's gold-perimeter detector with its 2.5% inset and lossless WebP conversion. All visible decoded pixels and alpha are verified against source. No resizing or synthetic detail. Always display through the shared circular frame/clip; generated outer-edge artifacts must not appear on the coin. Source PNGs are provenance; runtime WebPs are app assets.
