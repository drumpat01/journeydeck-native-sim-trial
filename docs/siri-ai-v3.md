# Siri AI in JourneyDeck V3

Implementation contract, September 18, 2026. This is the full V3 app, not a separate lab.
Native compilation and physical iPhone acceptance are required before release claims.

## Architecture

The existing authenticated Ask service remains the sole read-only native archive reader.
Recognized questions retain the deterministic fast path. Other questions use Apple's
on-device Foundation Models guided generation to produce a versioned query plan.
The model sees the question and authorized prior query context, never archive rows,
private labels, notes, photographs, audio, SQL, credentials, or record identifiers.
The query executor validates the plan, calculates facts, and formats the entire answer.
There is no generated answer prose or automatic cloud fallback. Siri's own processing
is controlled by Apple and the person's settings; this is not a promise that Siri is offline.

## Initial query coverage

| Domain | Supported facts and operations | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Journeys | count, total/average miles and minutes, earliest/latest, largest/smallest, date grouping, period comparison | Completed saved journeys; time filters use start time |
| Music | play count, artist/track/album filters and rankings, linked journey lookup | Repeat recorded plays count; not all real-world listening |
| Memories | created count, earliest/latest, photo counts, linked journey lookup | Creation time is distinct from the dates of included journeys |
| Markers | saved count, photos and voice-memo counts, earliest/latest, linked journey lookup | Only visible completed-journey segments; no notes or transcript search |
| Places | recorded arrival counts and rankings; named geocoded-place matching | Recorded endpoints, not continuous visits or inferred cities |
| Follow-ups | reuse period, filters, or a bounded previous selection | Five-minute authenticated context, invalidated on profile/lock changes |

Date ranges use the device's calendar/time zone, Monday-start weeks, and exclusive
end boundaries. Night means a journey beginning before 06:00 or at/after 18:00;
it does not mean astronomical sunset or time spent driving in darkness. Explicit
requests exceeding accessible history are refused, never silently truncated.
No recorded evidence, unsupported filters, ambiguous questions, route intersections,
photo recognition, note/transcript semantics, and unrecorded visits must be distinguished.
Start, Stop and Create Marker retain their explicit App Intents; the query planner is read-only.

## Privacy and future entity indexing

This first build opens supporting records through authenticated answer tickets.
Spotlight donation and iOS 27 search/open schemas are a subsequent integration,
not an active capability in this implementation. The intended policy is opt-in
indexing with generic date-based labels, dates, distances, durations,
and attachment counts. Names, notes, photos, transcripts, music metadata and locations
are not donated to Spotlight. Live entity resolution rechecks profile, lock and access.
Index lifetime is separate from answer tickets; disable, deletion, profile changes and
reindexing must remove stale entries. Use custom App Entities where no Apple schema fits.
Search/open schema adoption requires actual SDK validation; protocol conformance alone
does not prove arbitrary Siri phrasing works. Keep index testing distinct from model testing.

## Evaluation and build

The internal testing screen runs synthetic fixtures through the same native planner and
executor used by Siri; expected plans and numeric results are graded independently.
It reports unavailable, failed and cancelled evaluations separately. No synthetic records
are inserted into the user's archive. Questions/results stay in memory and clear on exit.
Real archive questions remain in the normal Ask screen with authenticated evidence links.

First physical-device sample (September 18, 2026, planner revision 1): Apple Intelligence
available, 2/13 passed, 11/13 failed, 4.3 seconds average; first case 6.5 seconds.
The two passes were unsupported requests. Nine supported questions reported an
unsupported decision; two reported invalid plans. Most refusal results otherwise
matched the expected fields. The screenshots do not include the raw invalid plans.

Revision 2 clarifies that decision `answer` authorizes execution by the archive engine,
not generation of a factual result by the model. It removes the conflicting "Never
answer it" instruction and generates the decision after the query fields. Metric,
ranking-limit and unused-field guidance is more explicit. Synthetic failures retain
the proposed/expected plans and validator reason, shown only in internal testing.
The strict executor still refuses unsupported or invalid plans. Revision 2 requires
a native rebuild and a fresh physical-device sample; local fixture passes do not
establish that the model interpretation has improved.

Revision 2 physical-device sample remained 2/13 with a 5.4 second average. Its new
diagnostics showed that the model generally extracted the correct domain, operation,
metric, period and filters, but filled constrained fields that were irrelevant to the
selected operation and classified supported queries as unsupported. Examples included
days=7 with thisWeek, date fields on an available-history query, comparePeriod on a
total, songPlays instead of count for the music domain, and limit=5 for a single top
artist. This evidence supersedes the initial prompt-only diagnosis.

Revision 3 treats model output as a proposal. A deterministic boundary canonicalizes
only fields whose applicability follows from another selected field, such as clearing
dates outside date/between and comparePeriod outside compare. It accepts a supported
proposal only when independent question cues agree with its domain, operation and
metric. Explicit writes, note/transcript or photo-content searches, vehicle data,
route-crossing/exclusion conditions, and ambiguous superlatives remain refused. Tests
replay all 13 observed device proposals and inject equivalent filler noise across all
100 phrasings, including refusal cases. Physical-device validation remains required.

Windows runs deterministic SQLite/engine, bridge, UI, privacy, and regression checks.
GitHub Actions compiles the complete app using a standard public macOS runner, signing
with an ad hoc profile containing the registered iPhone's UDID and correct CloudKit and
Watch identities. No EAS cloud build. Signing credentials and profiles are secrets, never
source or public artifacts. The device install uses HTTPS plus an installation manifest.
Native code, entity/schema declarations and bundled native resources require rebuilding;
React Native UI and supported JavaScript behavior can use compatible OTA updates.

Device acceptance: model availability, golden questions, cold/warm latency, Siri invocation,
follow-ups, Spotlight search/open/remove, lock during inference, A→B→A profile changes,
deletion, airplane mode, model-disabled fallback, active recording, VoiceOver, iPad and
large text. Existing V2 is frozen. No claim of perfect interpretation or fixed latency.
